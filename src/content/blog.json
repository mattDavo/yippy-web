        "content": "As a part of my learning experience in developing Yippy I have decided to learn reactive programming. As Yippy is being developed in Swift, I have chosen to use RxSwift. So I have started trying to implement the reactive programming patterns to Yippy. So far I have found it to be more difficult than I anticipated but I can tell that it is starting to make sense, and how I'm supposed to use and implement. I think it will continue to be a large learning curve but worthwhile.",
